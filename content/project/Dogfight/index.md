Using Pygame and with inspiration from the planes around me, I created a simple dogfighting pygame.
  In the Game, player 1 plays on WASD with Q & E to rotate and LSHIFT to shoot. Player 2 plays on IJKL 
  and uses U & O to rotate with RSHIFT to shoot. If players, collide then they both fall and game ends.
