1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week I worked a lot on my homework and going to class. I built the database and met with my Mengning about our project progress. We also diverted project subjects, so we are now in the process of changing directions and taking on new objectives with our new theme. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way, I have to work on populating the database, and I need to figure out how to begin implementing the data onto the actual website itself. This will be the majority of the work ahead of my group and getting it done will be a challenge. Given that we were able to do well on our last project, I'm confident that we will do fine on this phase as well. It will get done.
3. What will you do next week?

   1. Next week, I will be completing my homework for all classes, meeting with professors, and working on Database stuff for phase 2 of this project. I will also be getting back into the groove of the school year because the last two weekends were fully taken up by ACL and TX/OU game which consumed the entirety of both of my last weekends. While they were a lot of fun, I am very much drained and need a break and a wake-up call to get myself back into the routine.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #8: Liskov Substitution Principle**?

   1. I thought it was very interesting. Reading about how this principle fits alongside others such as the Open-Closed principle definitely gave lots of context as to how it fits in the grande schema of Object Oriented Design.
5. What was your experience of **comprehensions**, **generators**, and **yield**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting, the quizzes at the beginning of class helped make a lot of these instances very understandable and readable. Going through those instances and seeing how python reacts with a lot of design items makes a lot of sense now regarding how objects are treated.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week being around friends and talking about how busy and consumed current life is was very eye-opening and reassuring that we are all kind of going through a lot of stuff right now. To be able to have the commiseration of my friends was very nice and made me realize that we are all in this together and that we can all do it. 
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My pick of the week is to use Caitlin's guide on how to set up your DB on aws. Her guide was so simple and easy, I had my server set up within an hour. Massively helpful and easy to follow. Very happy that we have such helpful and experienced people on the TA staff.
