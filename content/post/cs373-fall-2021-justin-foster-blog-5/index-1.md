1. **What did you do this past week?**

   1. This past week I attended class and learned more about programming types and how operations are interpreted in python vs. java. I also began work with my team on our project proposal. We intend to do an IMDB for grocery stores, their locations, and their items.
2. **What's in your way?**

   1. This upcoming week I have my algorithms test and I also need to make significant progress for our first week project. We have made a good outline for what we need to do but the largest challenge will be just figuring out where to start.
3. **What will you do next week?**

   1. This next week we will begin work on our project and start laying the foundation for our database and project #2. I will also take my algorithms test and get ready for the events of the weekend coming up. 
4. **If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?**

   1. I very much enjoyed the paper. I have been a fan of pair programming since I had my first experience my freshman year in Data Structures.  I really enjoyed the process of Pair programming because it very often leads to me writing better code and having a better project.
5. **What was your experience of Python's object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators? (this question will vary, week to week)**

   1. I thought it was very interesting! I had always known that Python didn't have the ++ operator but learning about why it didn't was very interesting. Also, about types and which equals is which is very interesting as well.
6. **What made you happy this week?**

   1. This week I was very happy to see old friends and hang out in their sphere. Traveling out of Austin and seeing how others live is very refreshing. It's a great refresh to being a student to get out of your own area for a while and just experience different.
7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   1. My tip of the week is to apply to as many internships as possible and then to take as many online tests as you can to prepare. Even if you don't have any interest in the company, these tests will be the best way to practice assessments for the companies that you do care about.
