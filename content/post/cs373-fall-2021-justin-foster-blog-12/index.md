1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week was a slow but intense burn week. Lots of things to do and not much time to do it. This last week I attended classes and worked a little on Project number three as the due date is up and coming. On top of that, I worked on a project for my Ancient Rome classes looking into studies with Nazi connections to ancient Roman architecture and the effect on the country and leadership.
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way is finishing up my third project and also my project for ancient rome. This upcoming project is twenty percent of my grade in my ancient rome class so a good grade on this would be fantastic. On top of this, I have algorithm's homework to complete and then it will be Thanksgiving break the week after. 
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week I will complete my homework for my other classes and finish up aspects of project three just in case we don't complete all parts of the project this weekend. It will be another grind of a week but we are so close to finishing up the semester I can taste it. After this, it will be another grind for recruiting.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #12: More Getters and Setters**?

   1. MoreGetters and setters was very interesting. It seemed eerily similiar in nature and style tothe other getters and setters paper with more emphasis on when and when not to use getters and setters. It seemed to almost entirely condemn the use of both in any circumstance.
5. What was your experience of **cross join**, **theta join**, **natural join**, and **SQL**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting. With much to do and learn about, I felt the exercises were very helpful in learning about each and gave me insight into what happens in SQL.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week I had a lot of time with my friends, and being able to have a second to relax with the people around gives me hope for the break. I am very excited to be around people and forget about school for a month.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. Pick of the week is to have a hard cut off for yourself and to prioritize your mental health when dealing with a full load. There is nothing more important than having time for yourself and being able to mandate your own priorities over those set by school or expected by others.
