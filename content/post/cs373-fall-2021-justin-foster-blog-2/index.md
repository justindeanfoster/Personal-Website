1. **What did you do this past week?**

   I began my first week of classes, going to campus twice a week for my Roman Architecture Class and I also went for my discussion. In this class, I started making basic implementations of the Collatz project before I even realized there was a better procedure to developing so now I am restarting through those procedures to better implement the solution.
2. **What's in your way?**

   Collatz project and other homework for other classes are in my way in terms of things I need to get done. I will continue to work and knock out these projects and hopefully get them completed in a timely manner.
3. **What will you do next week?**

   Next week I will attend office hours and seek out help on the project and make sure I am well within spec to get these projects completed and turned in.
4. **If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #2: Makefile?**

   I thought it was interesting. I havent seen many Makefiles that long and extensive. To have multiple make types is interesting but definitely makes sense for the Collatz project.
5. **What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, and coverage? (this question will vary, week to week)**

   I have not used many unit tests or coverage tests in the past so learning about them in conjunction with more assertion knowledge has been very helpful in appreciating the tools developers have at their disposal.
6. **What made you happy this week?**

   Having our first game day at UT was very fun and seeing everyone proud to be here and proud to be back was a breath of fresh air in relation to how dismal things have been for a while.
7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   I am beginning to use LaTex for my Algorithms class and to do this, I have been using Overleaf which is a free, online LaTex development environment. While it is great for formatting documents for homeworks, it's even better for making a beautiful resume. I have used it for my Resume for the last couple of years and it has turned out better than any resume I could have made on any other editor.
