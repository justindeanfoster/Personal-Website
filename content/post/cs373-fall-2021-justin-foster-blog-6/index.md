1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week my team and I spent much of our time deploying the Website to AWS. This was difficult and arduous but eventually we got our site up and running. I also worked very hard on the homepage and the design of our website once we did get everything up and running.
2. What's in your way?

   1. The website is still in my way. While we made lots of progress on what we have and what we were able to do, we still have much of the other additional things to finish and complete before tomorrow. 
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This week I will continue to work on Project # 2 and begin to start on the backend stuff that will be required of us on Project # 3. This will be difficult but I believe the team will be able to get it done efficiently.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #6: Single Responsibility Principle**?

   1. I have not read it yet, but I intend to read it after this. It looks very interesting and applicable to life in computer science.
5. What was your experience of **factorial**, **reduce**, and **operators**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting. The time and space tradeoff specifically made me very interested in it because Python is a notoriously inefficient language so finding alternatives to doing very normal things is very helpful and cool.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week I went to ACL and saw a bunch of artists that are very cool and fun to watch. Today I am going to see Tyler, The Creator and his show will be amazing I'm sure.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My tip of the week is to use Ant Components for Java Script design. I have been using many of their components in order to help with my website design and it made it much easier to get my website up and running.
