1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week, my team finished up our Phase 2 for our web development project and turned it in. We were just about ready to turn in when Caitlin gave the extension, and with that, we were able to make last minute modifications and ensure that the website looked really good. Then, after that, I had a very chill week and just attended classes and worked through homework. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way this week will be a Test in Algorithms on Wedensday and then beyond that I will be working on Phase 3. There will be a lot of organizing my time and making sure I'm doing everything I need to and not missing out. After a hectic weekend, it will be a lot to gather my time and keep going.
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week I will study for Algorithms and then I will work with my team on implementing the Sorting and filtering for the project. I tend to work mostly in the front-end and so I'm looking forward to connecting the pages to the functinos from the backend and working towards getting it up and running.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle**?

   1. I thought it was very interesting. Papers regarding object -riented programming and principles to make everyday code more usable are very interesting.
5. What was your experience of **\=, \*, \**** and **regular expressions**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I have always been a little stumped by regular expressions, so learning them more in depth was very helpful and definitely cleared up a lot of question's I had regarding their uses. I definitely want to practice using them more.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week, it made me happy to finish phase 2 and have a very good team dynamic that was built on the stress of the second phase. While it was a tough phase, coming through with a finished project and one that I was proud of was a good feeling.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My Tip of the week is to get 8 hours of sleep each night. While college is hard, health is harder and keeping yourself responsible enough to be able to sleep plenty is a great feeling.
