1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week we finished up Phase 1 of the project and submitted it a few days late. We wanted to make sure we were able to complete all of the requirements and we though that this might be the best phase to do a slip day on. I also attended class and prepared to go to the Red River Rivalry. I'm currently writing this from my hotel room after the tough defeat.
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way for this upcoming week is a test in my Ancient Rome class and all the set up for phase 2, backend. I am somewhat anxious for this phase because it seems as though this phase is the most intensive and arduous. Either way, my team will be able to get it done.
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week we will be getting all of the groundwork laid to be able to put lots of headway into phase 2. We need our project to be nice and strong and given a good foundation in the backend, we should be able to put ourselves in a good place.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle**?

   1. I thought it was interesting,  a very neat way to model object oriented programs. While some of its ideals were very idealistic, in general, its principles will establish good foundations in any software environment.
5. What was your experience of **operators**, and **iteration**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. This weeks topic of operators and iteration was good! I understood it fairly well and was happy to be able to keep pace with the material. Python continues to show how interesting of a language it is.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week was a very difficult week in terms of assignments and obligations, but being surrounded by friends able to commiserate in the struggle of college is reassuring. I look forward to a lull in activities to be able to truly relax and get back to a solid schedule.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My tip of the week is to get ahead and work through your assignments as soon as you get them in order to make your life easier closer to the deadline. It has been excessively difficult these last couple of weeks to get ahead, but with better planning and organization, life surrounding school can be a lot easier.
