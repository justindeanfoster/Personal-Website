1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This last week my team and I finished up phase 3 for my project. This entailed implementing the filtering and searching and creating the front-end connections that allowed for this. . After that I did my ancient Rome presentation where I discussed the connections between a Nazi-era building in Nuremberg and its connections to power and politics similiar to buildings of the romans. From there, I have most of my assignments completed and squared away to set myself up for a fairly easy Thanksgiving break. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. There is not much in my way other than some algorithm homework, phase four for this class and a few smaller assignments that will just be a minor annoyance to get through. All in all, I'm set up for a fairly relaxing Thanksgiving break.
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week I will attend class and then on Wednesday I will fly out to South Carolina to visit family and my sister. I'm very excited for a break because this semester has truly felt like drinking from a fire hose.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil**?

   1. I thought it was very interesting as it parallels other papers that have discussed similar opposite ideas to things I have personally learned from the beginnings of my computer science career. It was interesting because it discusses how using etends often leads to a lack of flexibility in programs when they need to dynamically change.
5. What was your experience of **SQL**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting as it is my first experience in SQL. Beyond this, the exercises we worked on helped me get a very good experience in learning more about SQL.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week I finished up a lot of my homework and got through the majority of my projects. So for the next break, I will be working through the small projects I have left for the coming weeks. 
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My tip of the week is to enjoy your Thanksgiving break and try to take some time for yourself over this short break. We are coming up on the end of the semester and having a break for yourself is important for pacing yourself and prioritizing your mental health as we finish up this tough semester.
