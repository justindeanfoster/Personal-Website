1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This last week my team and I finished up phase 3 for my project. This entailed implementing the filtering and searching and creating the front-end connections that allowed for this. . After that I did my ancient Rome presentation where I discussed the connections between a Nazi-era building in Nuremberg and its connections to power and politics similiar to buildings of the romans. From there, I have most of my assignments completed and squared away to set myself up for a fairly easy Thanksgiving break. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. There is not much in my way other than some algorithm homework, phase four for this class and a few smaller assignments that will just be a minor annoyance to get through. All in all, I'm set up for a fairly relaxing Thanksgiving break.
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week I will attend class and then on Wednesday I will fly out to South Carolina to visit family and my sister. I'm very excited for a break because this semester has truly felt like drinking from a fire hose.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil**?
5. What was your experience of **SQL**? (this question will vary, week to week)
6. What made you happy this week?
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?
