1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This last week I studied a lot for my Algorithms test and then went to my classes. The test was on Wednesdaty and I felt it went okay. I am very glad we had the test though because there are two weeks surrounding each test where we do not have homework for ALgo and that is a huge relief around my schedule. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way this week is the third phase of the IDB project. My team has just begun work and will start implementing sorting and filtering on our website. Tonight, I think I will be adding the filter buttons to each model to allow my team to begin to connect to these new endpoints. I am very excited to see how our website ends up looking because I am fairly proud of the work we have done so far. 
3. What will you do next week?

   1. This next week we will make it so that our website is ready to be submitted for Phase 3 by completing sorting and filtering. This should not be too bad because we have a fairly decent grasp of what we are going to have to do and with this idea, the completion of this phase should not be as hard as the last.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #11: Getters and Setters**

   1. I thought it was super interesting as it starts the paper off with a very contradictory idea that many people in my computer science education would disagree with. The rationale surrounding it does make sense as it advocates for better abstraction in code and given these functions reveal almost entirely the inner workings of the program.
5. What was your experience of **relational algebra**, **select**, and **project**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting given that a lot of what this phase of IDB is, this material is very applicable and helpful to continue with the project. Using this information when we do specialized queries into the Tables will be super useful and gave me more insight into what we will need to do. 
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week I took my Algo test and it was nice to kind of have some days off to relax and dedicate almost entirely to myself. On top of this, the end of the semester is coming up and I am very excited to be at a point where I can rest and relax.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My tip of the week is to ask questions to use all available resources in this class. Because this is not the first time someone has ever designed a Database type website, there are a lot of resources available to be able to help you if you get stuck. For instance, Jefferson's website was very well made and because of that it's possible to look to his website for guidance.
