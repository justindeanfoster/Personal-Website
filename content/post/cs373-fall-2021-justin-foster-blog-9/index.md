1. What did you do this past week?

   1. This past week I worked with my team to try and get our second project done. With lots to do and more to get done, we got a decent chunk out of the beginning but now it will be a race against the clock to get the rest done. On top of that, I attended class and learned about functions, closures, and decorators. 
2. What's in your way?

   1. In my way is recruiting for internships and my second project. In the process of looking for a job for this summer has been consuming and tiring but I'm staying hopeful and eager to keep at it. With the second project, my team is working dilligently to get our infrastructures set up and get every aspect of the project up to spec. Something else in my way is my course schedule. I need to figure out what classes to take as my schedule is becoming more and more fluid. 
3. What will you do next week?

   1. Next week I will try to relax as it has felt like a race to do everything recently and a little relaxation would be a nice change of pace. I will attend class and work on our project, but as soon as we have the backend data completed, I feel as though the rest of the projects will be smooth sailing from here on out. 
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #8: Interface Segregation Principle**?

   1. I thought it was very interesting. I enjoy looking through interesting factors of object-oriented design and learning what should be considered the fundamentals of design in a new world of OOP. With these last papers under my belt, I'm confident that I can code with ease and have these heuristics incorporated into my designs.
5. What was your experience of **functions**, **closures**, and **decorators**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   1. I thought it was very interesting. I worked a lot with closures in a class last semester called Programming languages with Professor Cook. Its very interesting and being able to see what variables and properties are maintained is a refresher to understanding the base levels of code.
6. What made you happy this week?

   1. This week I was able to go to Texas Roadhouse with my friends and enjoy a nice throwback, quality meal with my boys. We pigged out on the blooming onion, steak, fried pickles, and sweet tea. Nothing gets better than that.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   1. My pick of the week is pgAdmin as it will easily allow you to view databases you have set up and also do searches on the data you have stored in it. This was a tip from the TA's but after discovering what you can do with it, it was helpful to find out for myself.
