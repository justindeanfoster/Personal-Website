1. **What did you do this past week?**

   This week I went to a less than full week of classes as we had Monday off for Labor day. Then, I went to classes and worked on my project. On Thursday, the social org I'm in had our first Coffee in which we showed off our new members. It was a lot of fun and a semblance of a return to normalcy. Then, I headed home to celebrate my Mom's birthday. For this class, I learned about optimizations in code and also worked on my Collatz project.
2. **What's in your way?**

   I'm still working on my Collatz project. I had a major roadblock in that my files were all broken due to the Window's file system placing an EOF "\r" at the ends of all my files and corrupting them all so that they could not be ran on my linux subsystem. Very annoying. Now, I'm working to finish up the project and add in the necessary optimizations.
3. **What will you do next week?**

   Next week is going to be very exciting. I will have finished the project and will be looking forward to the next, but on top of this I will be going to a date event with a friend and then we will also be having more events with my organization. Very exciting. 
4. **If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuos Integration?**

   I thought it was very interesting. It makes lots of sense after reading all the logic behind it and understanding why this practice is good and worthwhile.
5. **What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations? (this question will vary, week to week)**

   Collatz optimizations are difficult, however, I will be spending the next day or so making sure I get my optimizations running and working. The isPrime optimization is also very interesting considering that the bug to be fixed was something I had learned in a class previous to this one and knew how to fix it.
6. **What made you happy this week?**

   Being with my friends and enjoying their company during a stressful week made me happy and allowed me to have a better week.
7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   My tip of the week is to start early. I have been doing my best to start early but as I get caught behind, it becomes harder and harder to not feel the pressure. When you have plenty of time to finish and push yourself to get ahead, the stress of assignments piling up and projects seem a lot more complete-able.
