1. What did you do this past week?

   I went to class and finished up my project and got it turned in. Other than that, I attended lectures for other classes and worked a little on the homework.
2. What's in your way?

   I feel that we will be assigned groups in the coming week based off of CATME survey being released so I assume the next project will be in my way. I am eager and a little nervous to begin the first group project.
3. What will you do next week?

   Next week, I will start the group project with my team and we will try to make good progress and understand the project guidelines. I also will do a bunch of homework and studying for my algorithms class because we have a test coming up.
4. If you read it, what did you think of the **Paper #4: What Happens to Us**?

   I thought the article was super interesting and eye opening. Realizing that this kind of thing happens in industry all the time is shameful and a good reminder that you can always do more to show respect to others. 
5. What was your experience of **Collatz**, **exceptions**, and **types**? (this question will vary, week to week)

   I finished Collatz and felt very at peace as I generally just have awful luck with computer stuff so after I fixed a million bugs and worked through weird errors, it was very nice to finally be done with it in the very end. Exceptions are very interesting and types are very interesting especially in python where I used to pretend everything had no type.
6. What made you happy this week?

   Finishing the Collat problem this week made me happy. Other than that, hanging out with friends and having fun around where I live was very fun.
7. What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

   My pick of the week is to practice Technical interviews with the technical interviews section of hackerrank or with LeetCode. I personally found that I like LeetCode better but whatever site you can find to use will give ample to be able to ace interview questions.
