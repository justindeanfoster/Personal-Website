Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in developing scalable data-driven machine learning solutions. Passionate
about applying statistics, data science, and machine learning to solve big data challenges. Eager to leverage expertise and
leadership in data-driven projects and predictive modeling. In my spare time, I am interested in sketching + photographing the world around me, playing new songs on new instruments, and sitting on my couch.
