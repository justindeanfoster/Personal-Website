My name is Justin Foster and I am a Senior Computer Science Student at UT Austin. I have loved to build my entire life beginning beginning with legos and becoming code. I enjoy carpentry and photography as some of my hobbies: I have built a set of record shelves and an 8 foot table as well as gone on some amazing trips where I captured great photos. I am deeply passionate about Space and its intersection with cutting-edge technology and it is my dream to work on this technology.
